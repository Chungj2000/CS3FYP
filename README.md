## Purpose
The aim of this project is to create a **turn-based strategy game** that can be used to develop core skills that will be useful in real world scenarios, such as * *decision making* *, * *risk taking* *, and * *problem solving* *. Said game is envisioned to potentially be used as a medium for education and entertainment in such a way that Chess is treated as an extra curriculum activity in some schools.
